Xenophobia and ‘othering’ - defining who is in and out - are often a result from crises. Xenophobia extends far beyond the identity of the parties involved in a violent conflict (e.g. war, terrorist attacks). For example, Asian phobia in the USA was observed after Pearl Harbour, and Anti-Islamism (or general xenophobia) was observed in the USA and Europe after terrorist attacks. Xenophobia can even reach people in countries not directly affected if they feel their core values, like national security, are at risk</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div>\n<!-- /wp:column --></div>\n<!-- /wp:columns -->"
