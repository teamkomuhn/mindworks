Fear has proven a powerful motivator for people to shift core values or foster Norm Regress (the ‘death of a norm’). Governments have employed it to shift perceptions and pass laws that violate previously held values (e.g. norm regression on torture and civil rights, or the acceptance of extra-jurisdictional killings). Norms are amended through narratives (while torture is not acceptable, it becomes just when preventing a terrorist attack) and then perpetuated by social media and the entertainment industry.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div>\n<!-- /wp:column -->\n\n<!-- wp:column -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The negotiation of new mindsets in society is not an egalitarian process. It is influenced by propaganda campaigns led by powerful entities, be it governments or interest groups. These groups use media and social media - including trolls - to spread information or disinformation to influence human minds. An example is the identity battle between China and Taiwan during the pandemic concerning their WHO status. Negotiation processes of new mindsets can divert between groups within societies leading to increased polarisation and fragmentation; it can also reduce political divides or shift alliances, sometimes affecting existing power and social structures.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div>\n<!-- /wp:column --></div>\n<!-- /wp:columns -->"
